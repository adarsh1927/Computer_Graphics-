⚫ ## When we can draw curvy lines in 2D proggramme why not we can draw simply in 3D why we need (vertext, edge, face)?

When you draw a smooth line in 2d graphics if you zoom you will find series of pixels make it and they are not smooth at all.  

I am not talking about physical pixel i am talking about imaginary mathmaticle system or cordinates.

Over cordinate system is not bending actually it simply going straight in any direction (hieght, width, depth).

So in many visualization little box going every where but in uniform sequence if they are going left they will go straight
if they are going up they will go straight if they going toward depth it also will be uniform depth.

Why not our cornate system bending over period of steps? May any alien civiliztation use that type of complecity in mathmatics
but if we play that type of game we will loose.
