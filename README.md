âš« When we can draw curvy lines in 2D proggramme why not we can draw simply in 3D why we need (vertext, edge, face)?

**Coordinate System**  

When you draw a smooth line in 2d graphics if you zoom you will find series of pixels make it and they are not smooth at all.  

I am not talking about physical pixel I am talking about imaginary mathematical system or coordinate.

Our cordinate system is not bending actually it simply going straight in hieght, width and depth.

So in many visualization of coordinates there are small boxes or squares going everywhere but in a uniform order if they are going left they will go straight, if they are going up they will go straight if they are going deeper it will also be a uniform depth.

Why not our coordinate system bending over period of steps? May any alien civilization use that type of complexity in mathematics but if we play that type of game we will loose.

**Calculation Need Resource**

3D software doing more calculation than 2D software so they are designed to balance between output and calculation.  

3D software is designed to keep in mind the challenge of resource consumption while achieving desired results.
